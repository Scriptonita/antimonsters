AntiMonsterS turns your smartPhone into a sophisticated system of detection and protection against all kind of monsters and undesirable unreal beings.

AntiMonsterS helps your children or daughters feel insurances at night, scanning with our incredible scanner of 5 dimensions the zones by which they believe that those beings  enter their room. Launch the protection spell if you want to protect a room and to the people who are present. Or you can activate the radar detector of activity that detects any presence in a great radius around you of any kind of monsters, ghosts, witches, etcâ€¦

* 5-dimensional scanner : as everybody knows, monsters do not live in our world, live in other dimensions or parallel worlds and use portals to go from one world to another. These portals they usually place in closets or under the beds.  For these beings can to pass through dimensions, these portals have to stabilize many hours ahead. If at the time of go to sleep you pass the scanner and do not detect anything, you can sleep peacefully, because it will not give time in a single night to create a portal, stabilize and pass through it. In the case that the scanner detects some sign, no fear, you have time to solve it with our protection system.

* Protection: the most powerful spell never created to be launched through an iPhone. It protects both the people who are present when it is realised, and the zone where spell is realised. It protects to the people with a repulsive against monsters that will cause that these cannot approached of any way. It protects the zone with a layer of protection impossible to go through by monster and destroys any portal that there is in the zone. In addition, it emits an ultrasound, impossible to hear by the people, but that is unbearable for any kind of monster that could be already hidden by the zone and it forces to him to flee without remedy for him.

* Radar: surely you neither have the permission nor the desire to go by all the houses of your neighborhood scanning closets and beds. You do not worry, with the radar you could be abreast of any intrusion that could around have in a great radius around you.

AntiMonsterS wants to help to the young children lose the fear to the  monsters/ghosts/sorceresses/etc. for that they can sleep calmly by the nights and therefore help the parents.
